# Unfoldable

Import fold sample over https://origamisimulator.org/ (found from the link in the fold file: http://git.amandaghassaei.com/OrigamiSimulator/)


Import the model, show advanced options and play with the settings:

- Edge Visibility:
    - leave only "Boundary Edges" to only have the flag outlined.
- Fold Percet: 0%
- Numerical Integration: Verlet (this is probably the most important setting to have)
- All other settings on the right close to 0

The goal is to manage to "unfold" the thing with the flag written in the middle
We can grab some edges and faces with the mouse to try to help  the simulation unfolding it.
